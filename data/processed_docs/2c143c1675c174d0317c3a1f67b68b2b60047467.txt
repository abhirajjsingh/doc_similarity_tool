INTRODUCTION
Humanitarian organizations rely more than ever on digital technologies to assist and protect people in 
crisis.1 These technologies enable humanitarians to gather data to understand and respond to the needs of 
affected people, and offer new channels to deliver aid through unprecedented digital proximity.2 However, 
this increased digitalization is not without risks—chief among them is the growing risk of cyber threats.3 
Cyber threats are one of the most pressing issues facing the humanitarian sector today.4 Digital 
transformation, increasing dependence on information and communications technology (ICT), and the 
prevalence of cyber threats create a new array of risks for humanitarian agencies and the people they serve.

•	 In April 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mercy Corps and the International 
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) reported a drastic uptick in data protection 
breaches,5 and the World Health Organization (WHO) noted a fivefold increase in the number of cyber 
threats against the organization.6
•	 In May 2021, hackers gained access to the email marketing account of the United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID), emailing over 150 organizations in an apparent attempt to hack 
them.7 
•	 In February 2022, a highly targeted cyber operation against servers of the International Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC) which compromised sensitive data of more than 515,000 individuals was 
detected.8
These attacks may cause serious harm. They violate the privacy of the people whose data is compromised, 
risk exposing sensitive information about them and erode trust in humanitarian organizations’ capabilities. 
In response to these attacks, a number of new initiatives signal increased investment in this area. For 
example, ICRC is considering the development of a ‘digital emblem’9 and has also opened a new delegation 
for cyberspace in Luxembourg.10 NetHope has established an Information Sharing and Analysis Center that 
will help support the information security needs of nonprofit agencies and the world’s most vulnerable 
communities.11 However, the sector lacks a shared approach to mitigating the risk and potential impact of 
cyber threats.
This Guidance Note aims to help build a common understanding and support more strategic, collective 
action within the sector. It provides an overview of the cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and implications 
facing humanitarians and people affected by crises, and offers recommendations to increase cyber 
resilience within and across organizations and their partners.
Definitions
Cybersecurity entails a combination of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, 
risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be 
used to protect the cyber environment, and organization and user assets against relevant security risks in 
the cyber environment.12 
Information and data security entails a set of physical, technological and procedural measures that 
safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, and prevent its accidental or intentional, 
unlawful or otherwise unauthorized loss, destruction, alteration, acquisition or disclosure.13 
Cyber threats encompass ‘activities that occur at least in part within the cyber realm, utilizing and/or 
targeting information communications technologies to achieve an effect that is not authorized by the 
legitimate user of the data or the ICT and/or has a harmful intent or effect on the victim or victims’.14
Cyber resilience refers to an organization’s capacity to identify, prevent and detect cyber threats, and 
respond and recover.

CYBER THREATS
To increase cybersecurity within the sector, organizations must first understand the threats they may face 
in this sphere. Cyber threats comprise a wide variety of activities and behaviors that can be distinguished 
by the types of actors behind them and their motives. Actors range from nation-states to criminal 
organizations and private persons or combinations thereof. The affiliation and goals of actors can inform 
how aggressively they behave, how sophisticated attacks are, which methods are used and who is targeted. 
Cyber threats can be direct or indirect, depending on the target. Direct cyber threats, which target 
humanitarian organizations, have increased in recent years. Indirect cyber threats target the infrastructure 
or services that people affected by or responding to humanitarian crises rely on for survival and aid 
delivery.
Cyber threats can also be classified according to their type or mode. These include Denial-of-service (DoS) 
and Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks,15 malware,16 and ransomware,17 among others. 
The following examples illustrate what cyber threats might look like in practice: 
•	 Cyber warfare refers to ‘operations against a computer, a computer system or network, or another 
connected device, through a data stream, when used as means or methods of warfare in the context 
of an armed conflict’.18 In Ukraine, cyber-attacks have undermined the distribution of medicines, food 
and relief supplies since February 2022.19 Their impact has ranged from preventing access to basic 
services to data theft and disinformation.
•	 Misinformation, disinformation and hate speech (MDH) refers to the organized dissemination 
(intentional or unintentional) of false information through means of ICT which discredits political, 
military or civil society actors, or spreads, incites, promotes or justifies hatred and violence based on 
intolerance. In Myanmar, a campaign of MDH with derogatory and dehumanizing language against the 
Rohingya Muslim minority of the country has been linked to the commission of grave human rights 
violations.20
 
•	 Cybercrime refers to criminal offenses that are cyber-enabled (committed through the means of ICT) 
or cyber-dependent (only possible because of ICT). 
•	 Cyber sabotage refers to activities aiming to disrupt or destroy the reliable and error-free functioning 
of ICT. If an act of sabotage is carried out by perpetrators with terrorist motives, it is referred to as 
cyber terrorism.

COMMON VULNERABILITIES IN THE HUMANITARIAN SECTOR 
Humanitarian actors should investigate and understand potential vulnerabilities that might impact their 
cyber resilience, and make them more susceptible to becoming victims of cyber threats. These include 
infrastructure flaws, inadequate basic cybersecurity and digital literacy, human error and the absence of a 
coordinated approach. 
1.	 Infrastructure flaws
Cyber threats are commonly associated with sophisticated technical operations targeting vulnerabilities 
in information infrastructure.21 Common vulnerabilities of this type relevant to the humanitarian sector 
include: 
•	 Legacy systems: Outdated computing software and/or hardware that are unable to resist 
contemporary forms of attack, and present a risk for other applications and data that may share the 
same infrastructure.22
•	 Default or improper configuration: Out-of-box systems, i.e., with default or simple passwords and 
overly permissive configurations are easier for attackers to compromise.23
 
•	 Lack of encryption: In the absence of encryption, attackers can use software to discover usernames 
and passwords. A lack of encryption means that an attacker can access the data on compromised 
devices. Data that is transferred via unencrypted channels is also at risk of unauthorized access. 
•	 Third-party infrastructure: Attackers can infiltrate ICT systems through an outside partner or 
vendor by exploiting different vulnerabilities.24 Attackers may also gain access to the data stored by 
providers. Disruption of critical infrastructure through cyber operations can lead to a shutdown of 
essential services, which can have grave consequences for people in need and disrupt humanitarian 
operations.25 Vendor lock-in due to product incompatibilities, low levels of interoperability or 
portability, or limited alternatives in the market are also major concerns.26
2.	 Inadequate basic cybersecurity and digital literacy
Cybersecurity preparedness, organizational readiness and digital literacy remain limited in the 
humanitarian sector.27 Inadequate data literacy, and a lack of consistent practices and tools to ensure 
cybersecurity are widespread among humanitarian organizations. Cybersecurity continues to be seen as a 
predominantly technical issue, leading to little engagement from staff or leadership to raise awareness of 
threats and equip people across organizations with the skills and tools required to mitigate risk. This lack 
of engagement and focus also translates into a lack of resources and funding for cybersecurity.28 Even as 
humanitarian actors digitalize their operations, gaps remain between the investment in the front end of 
technology (building it, deploying it, and closing out the project), and the back end (maintaining services 
and keeping information secure and protected over time).29

    Challenges To Practice.Signal Program on Human Security and Technology, Harvard Humanitarian Initiative.
3.	 Human error 
There has been a discernible shift from hackers attacking servers, networks and devices to ‘hacking 
people’ in recent years.30 Ninety-five percent of cybersecurity breaches are now caused by human error.31 
Social engineering techniques (phishing, impersonation, etc.) aimed at manipulating individuals into 
divulging sensitive information are the most prevalent means of exploiting this vulnerability. Most of these 
techniques are designed to reach a high number of users simultaneously, maximizing the likelihood of a 
breach. These intrusions can go undetected for extended periods of time, giving attackers access to internal 
security architecture and confidential information, which in turn offers further opportunities for attack.
Human error that increases vulnerability to cyber threats may include: 
•	 accidental abuse by users with authorized and legitimate access to computer systems;
•	 unauthorized use by attackers enabled by a compromised user;
 
•	 disregard by personnel for security policies and procedures; and 
•	 errors in the configuration or operation of systems.
4.	 Absence of coordinated approach
There is an acute gap in coordination on cyber-related issues in the humanitarian sector. This gap exists 
both within and between organizations. Few organizations have teams dedicated to cybersecurity or tasked 
with detecting, assessing and mitigating cyber risks. No single entity is formally tasked with coordinating 
a harmonized approach to cybersecurity in the sector, despite the existence of initiatives such as the ones 
described above, the development of resources and apparent political will.32 
The lack of coordination means that organizations lack visibility on attacks experienced by their peers, are 
unable or do not have policies in place to consistently share information on experienced cyber threats or 
lessons learned, and are not investing in collective approaches to reducing vulnerabilities and mitigating 
risk.33
HUMANITARIAN IMPLICATIONS OF CYBER THREATS
The humanitarian implications of cyber threats are significant. They can compromise the ability to deliver 
assistance and protection, as well as exacerbate humanitarian needs by disrupting services essential 
for survival. Cyber threats can result in surveillance, discrimination, persecution and other harmful 
consequences for affected populations, exacerbate the insecurities of already vulnerable groups and 
individuals, erode trust and compromise the principled delivery of humanitarian assistance.34
Delivering principled aid means that humanitarian services and assistance are aligned with the 
principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.35 To act with neutrality in the digital 
realm, humanitarian actors ‘must ensure that the data and systems they employ do not provide any 
tactical military or operational advantage to parties engaged in hostilities’.36 The humanitarian principle 
of independence might be in conflict with the dependence of ICT-supported humanitarian work on 
infrastructure owned and managed by private companies affiliated with different states. The overarching 
principle of ‘Do No Harm’ further obliges all humanitarians to avoid exposing people to additional risks

through humanitarian action, requiring humanitarians to take a step back from an intervention to look at 
the broader context and mitigate potential negative effects.37 
Cyber threats directly affect a number of key humanitarian domains, such as protection, access, and 
accountability to affected people (AAP) and communicating with communities (CwC). As the technical tools 
for managing data in these different areas have evolved faster than the policy instruments that govern their 
use, organizations must exercise caution as they design and deploy digital technologies. The sections below 
offer considerations to help organizations better understand and address the humanitarian implications of 
cyber threats across these domains.
1.	 Protection 
For humanitarian organizations, protection entails advocating for and supporting actions that aim to 
reduce and prevent people’s exposure to risks and to ensure respect for the rights of individuals by those 
responsible.38 Humanitarians must consider how cyber threats and related vulnerabilities impact their 
protection responsibilities, what effects technology might have on the distribution of resources, and how 
reliance on cyber infrastructure and vendors is redefining relationships.39 
Information about the location of vulnerable people, as well as data that allows for re-identification 
of victims of gender-based violence are two examples of protection-specific concerns that might be 
exacerbated by the use of ICT as they might render such information more easily accessible to threat 
actors.40 Another protection concern is that of the protection of humanitarian data. For example, the use of 
social media has become more commonplace in the delivery of services, but this brings with it a number of 
significant data protection risks such as profiling.41 
2.	 Access 
Humanitarian access refers to both humanitarian actors’ ability to reach populations in need and affected 
populations’ ability to access assistance and services.42 
The use of ICT can help increase and simplify beneficiaries’ access to humanitarian services such as cash 
assistance, referral services or healthcare. The increased reliance by humanitarians on digital technologies, 
and the related dependencies on external and internal infrastructure and services, can however bring new 
challenges. 
Access to services can be impeded by the inherent vulnerabilities of the sectors on which organizations 
and beneficiaries rely (such as healthcare, logistics, banking, and more).43 The continuity of services in the 
digital space is not always a given—internet shutdowns and network failures can cause major disruptions 
to the provision of essential services.44 In Kenya, such a network failure led to ‘occasional delays, disruption 
or cancellation of the food distribution in the camps, contributing to long queues and crowd control 
challenges’.45

3.	 Accountability to affected people and communications with communities 
Accountability to affected people is an active commitment to use power responsibly by taking account of, 
giving account to, and being held to account by the people humanitarian organizations seek to assist.46 
Communications with Communities aims to meet the information and communications needs of people 
affected by crisis.47
Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information is paramount to AAP and CwC. Increasingly, 
humanitarians provide this information at least in part through digital channels, either to complement 
face-to-face services or where physical proximity to communities is not feasible. This dependency on digital 
services means that cyber operations stand to have grave humanitarian repercussions. 
One particular threat related to AAP and CwC is misinformation, disinformation and hate speech, which 
has become more prevalent with the increased use of ICT.48 MDH can put affected communities and 
humanitarian workers at risk by further destabilizing fragile environments, increasing vulnerability and 
affecting humanitarian organizations’ reputation.49
Recommendations
Humanitarian organizations should consider the following recommendations to improve cyber resilience.
Invest in cybersecurity as a cross-organizational issue by:
•	 Integrating cybersecurity into broader organizational frameworks and strategies, including relevant 
legal, technical and operational safeguards. 
 
•	 Promoting an active stance from staff at all levels through awareness-raising programmes and 
displaying an engaged leadership style on cybersecurity matters overall.50
•	 Allocating appropriate long-term and flexible funding for cybersecurity and data responsibility as an 
integral component of humanitarian programming. 
•	 Advocating for increased investment into the responsible operations of digital technologies to reduce 
related vulnerabilities.
Enhance institutional preparedness by:
•	 Identifying and analyzing common cybersecurity challenges including identifying potential threats 
and threat actors specific to their work, as well as the potential vulnerabilities in their operations and 
systems.
•	 Conducting regular risk assessments to identify threats and vulnerabilities, particularly when planning 
new cyber-enabled activities or exploring new technologies to support activities.
•	 Implementing several mitigation measures, such as putting in place security standards for hardware 
and software, and adopting a ‘zero trust’ approach that favors restrictions such as least-privilege 
access, microsegmentation and multi-factor authentication. 
•	 Diversifying supply chains to remove strong supplier dependencies, and considering free and open 
source alternatives (as long as they are approved or appropriately vetted).
•	 Developing and adapting existing technologies to humanitarian situations, and ensuring 
contextualized tailoring, testing, efficacy and safety before deployment.

working practices.
•	 Building digital literacy of humanitarian actors through cross-sector hires and upskilling.
•	 Increasing data literacy to enable staff to adopt responsible practices and improve their cyber hygiene, 
including practicing good password management, using anti-virus/anti-malware software and 
avoiding phishing scams.52
Improve coordination and collaboration by:
•	 Creating an environment that fosters a culture of coordination, collaboration and information sharing 
among actors.
•	 Integrating into wider public and private sector cybersecurity communities, ensuring they participate 
in threat intelligence analysis and information-sharing channels, including disclosure.
•	 Partnering with relevant stakeholders to improve cybersecurity and humanitarians’ access to new 
areas of expertise and technologies.53
•	 Supporting existing initiatives, systems and projects, for example promoting interoperable data 
sharing platforms with adequate protections for personal and sensitive data within and across 
organizations and sectors.
•	 Communicating about initiatives, threat scanning and  potential breaches to highlight the issue of 
cybersecurity and support the development of a knowledge base, fostering a more coordinated 
approach to incident management over time.
The Centre for Humanitarian Data (‘the Centre’), together with key partners, is publishing a set of guidance 
notes and tip sheets on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action over the course of 2022 and 2023. These 
complement the Centre’s series of guidance notes and tip sheets, as well as the Inter-Agency Standing 
Committee Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action and the OCHA Data 
Responsibility Guidelines, which were published in February 2021 and October 2021 respectively. Through the 
series, the Centre aims to support continued engagement from different stakeholder groups around high-level 
commitments and collective action on data responsibility. These guidance notes have been made possible with 
the support of the Government of Switzerland.
This Guidance Note on the Humanitarian Implications of Cyber Threats builds on OCHA’s publications on cyber 
related issues in the humanitarian sector, including Humanitarianism in the Age of Cyber-warfare: Towards the 
Principled and Secure Use of Information in Humanitarian Emergencies and the 2022 Overview Paper on Virtual 
Risk, Tangible Harm: The Humanitarian Implications of Cyber Threats.54
